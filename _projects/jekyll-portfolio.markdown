### Jekyll & Siteleaf
I built this portfolio on Jekyll 4.0, using Siteleaf as a CMS. It was the first time I've ever really taken the time to work with Jekyll and learn it.

### Ditching Wordpress
Prior to building this portfolio, I was working with Wordpress. And while it was nice at first it ended up not giving me the control and creative freedom I wanted as a developer. So I scrapped two days of work in favor of Jekyll and the site you're on right now which I built from the ground up without a framework.

I'm very proud of this project and will continue to iterate on it over time as well as build more projects on Jekyll in the future.
