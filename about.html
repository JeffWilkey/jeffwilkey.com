      Hi, I'm Jeff. I'm a web developer and am passionate about what I do. I love finding creative solutions to tough
      problems and really enjoy working with others. I first started programming in 2015, fell in love with the process and
      after 3 months at bootcamp, I started working right away. It's been a while since then and I've learned a ton working
      on web and mobile applications as a full-stack developer with different clients all around the U.S. Most recently I
      was contracted to be part of a small project at a company called Future Foundry and ended up working with their team
      for over a year on five different applications both web and mobile that all went into production at one point. Now, I'm starting a
      new chapter of my career and looking for new opportunities to continue doing what I love!
